This project investigates the influence of income, population growth, taxation, and location on housing prices and affordability in Connecticut between 2010 and 2022. The objectives were to assess how economic factors drive real estate market trends and how affordability varies across regions. The analysis involved cleaning and merging datasets on real estate sales, household income, taxes, and population, followed by calculating town-level averages of housing prices and income. Methods such as calculating the Housing Affordability Index , performing regression analyses to study the elasticity of housing prices relative to income growth, and using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of multiple factors were key components. The visualizations including bar charts, scatter plots, choropleth maps, and time-series graphs, highlighted regional disparities and trends over time. Key findings reveal that higher-income towns with faster population growth tend to experience greater housing price inflation, while taxation policies tend to contribute to reducing housing affordability in wealthier areas. Towns with slower population growth and lower taxes generally have more affordable housing, but they often lack economic opportunities. The elasticity analysis revealed that housing prices are highly sensitive to income changes, particularly in high-demand towns. Recommendations for policymakers include increasing the supply of affordable housing, offering tax relief to middle- and lower-income households in high-demand areas, and promoting balanced regional growth by investing in infrastructure and employment in smaller towns. For investors, targeting high-growth areas with increasing incomes and moderate tax burdens offers strong long-term potential, while households should consider both affordability and long-term economic trends when making homebuying decisions
